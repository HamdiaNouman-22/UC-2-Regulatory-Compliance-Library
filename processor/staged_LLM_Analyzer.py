Extract structured requirements and atomic obligations from the regulatory circular below.

━━━ EXTRACTION RULES ━━━
- Extract ONLY binding obligations that use words like: must, shall, required to, obligated to.
- Ignore explanatory text, preambles, definitions, and non-binding guidance.
- If a sentence contains more than one distinct action, split it into separate atomic obligations.
- Do not split obligations that share a single subject and are logically inseparable into one action.
- Preserve the exact regulatory meaning — do not paraphrase or interpret beyond what is written.
- Do not invent any content.
- Each obligation must be independently testable by an auditor.

━━━ GROUPING RULES ━━━
- Group obligations into logical requirement clusters by topic (e.g. cash management, staffing, pricing display, security, reporting).
- Each requirement group should contain between two and six obligations — never more than six.
- If the regulation has no explicit section numbers, infer groupings from semantic topic, not paragraph order.
- Aim for between four and eight requirement groups total regardless of document length.

━━━ DEDUPLICATION RULES ━━━
- Before returning, check every obligation against all others in the same requirement group.
- If two obligations share the same core action and subject, keep only one — discard the duplicate entirely.
- Do not extract the same sentence or list item twice even if it appears more than once in the source text.

━━━ LANGUAGE RULES ━━━
- The document is in {language}. ALL output fields must be written in {language}.
- Do NOT translate. Preserve exact regulatory meaning in the original language.

- Ignore explanatory text, preambles, definitions, and non-binding guidance.

- Do not split obligations that share a single subject and are logically inseparable into one action.

- Do not invent any content.
- Each obligation must be independently testable by an auditor.
- Note each obligation's source reference (e.g. article/section number) exactly as it appears.

━━━ TOPIC TAGGING ━━━
- Tag each obligation with a short 2-4 word compliance topic label, e.g. "Capital Adequacy",
  "Licensing", "Credit Limits", "Reporting", "Governance", "Liquidity", "Consumer Protection",
  "Data Confidentiality", "Real Estate", "Investment Limits". Prefer one of these when it
  genuinely fits; otherwise write a short, precise label of your own.
- Do NOT decide how obligations should be grouped into requirement clusters — that happens
  separately, outside this call. Just tag the topic per obligation.
