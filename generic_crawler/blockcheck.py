"""Is this page the site, or a bot-protection wall pretending to be one?

A WAF challenge page returns HTTP 200, is valid HTML, and carries a plausible
amount of text. Nothing about it looks like a failure — SIMAH's Cloudflare block
was stored as 1,054 characters of "law", which is over the 200-character
threshold that decides a page is a document. So the check cannot be "did the
request fail"; it has to read the page.

Lives in its own module because two engines need it and the dependency may only
run one way: `generic_crawler` must not import from `dynamic_crawler`
(README: this folder is self-contained). `crawler.py` imports `strategies.py`,
never the reverse, so a helper both of them use cannot live in either one.

The outcome vocabulary that consumes this lives in `crawler.py::run_status`.
